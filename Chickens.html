		You were always where we didn't want you,<br>
		Scratching among the seeds<br>
		You pecked at blueberries and brambles<br>
		And turned over the soil,<br>
		But with every step I took you followed,<br>
		Cooing at my feet,<br>
		You led me to your secret clutches<br>
		Of white jewels in the scrub.<br>
		And now you&rsquo;ve left I miss your mischief,<br>
		Your chirps behind each step,<br>
		Your knotting in between my ankles<br>
		And pecking at our crops,<br>
		Our garden may be full without you,<br>
		Our berries left to ripen,<br>
		But the walls are quiet without your crowing,<br>
		The slugs left to flourish,<br>
		So i miss your constant scratching and clawing,<br>
		Your trails left in the earth,<br>
		Our garden will always be empty without you<br>
		And your gentle chirps.<br>
