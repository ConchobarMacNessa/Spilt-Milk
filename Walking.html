		In October 2015 I left the busy lights of Kyoto behind to set forth on my own adventure in rural Japan. Armed with nothing but wanderlust, I navigated the maze of city trains to find my home for the next few hours. As we set off, the view became much more rural as the city sloped away. First we passed through smaller towns and cities, then tiny fishing villages, until finally nothing but the countryside stretched out either side around us. After a few hours we reached my stop, Tanabe, and I changed onto a rickety bus that twisted away from the coast and up the mountains. We would duck into dark mountain paths and each time the bus would gasp for air on the other side of the tunnel, I would catch a glimpse of the scenery, hills coated with tall fir tress, glistening water and blistering blue sky, before being plunged once again into the dark depths of the mountain tunnel. One last time rolled out of the darkness and the bus driver pulled up and looked at me expectantly. With my rudimentary Japanese, I surmised that this was my stop and, laden with bags, I exited the bus. As it drove away I realised that I was completely alone, and this wouldnâ€™t be the first time I had this realisation. Now I could hear no man made sounds. Only the trickling of the river, the craw of the birds, and the rustling of unseen creatures in the bushes that fled at my approach. I crossed the nearby bridge and stood to admire my surroundings. The landscape engulfed me: rolling hills painted bright green with the trees that lined them, and a wide streaming river with crystal clear water. I stood for several minutes watching the intricate patterns the several schools of fish made in the water beneath me before moving onto the small shrine that lay at the foot of the pilgrimage route. The trail rose before me.
